<br/>
To connect PC and a Switch we use <b>Copper Straight Through Cable</b>.<br/>
Router by default are turned off.<br/>
Each port on a switch is it's own collision domain.<br/>
<br/>
Router is Level 3 device, our Gateway.<br/>
<br/>
Switches are smart, and they already configured, you can still configure it, because you want to manage it. We need an IP address to get into the switch. And to get remotely into the switch you need a gateway.<br/>
We give IP adress to vlan's.</body></html>
