It is an Information technology (IT) certification from Cisco Systems.<br/>
<br/>
Passing ICND1 exam grants the candidate the Cisco Entry Level Techician (CCENT) certification.<br/>
<br/>
ICND -&gt; Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices<br/>
<br/>
CCNA 200-120 for Routing and Switching<br/>
<br/>
In 1998 at Philadelphia Networker Show, Cisco introduced the entry level ccna certification as a precursor to all new Cisco certifications.<br/>
Hub (Ethernet hub) is a Layer 1 device. A <b>Hub </b>is the most basic networking device that connects multiple computers or other network devices together. Unlike network switch or router, a network hub has no routing tables or intelligence on where to send information and broadcasts all network data across each connection. It is a shared collision &nbsp;domain, which will lead to cut in bandwidth. You do not want to have hubs on your network as they will cut down your bandwidth. As only one pair of wires is being used, so you could only receive or sent at a given time. Now-a-days, hubs are being out of the networks. Half duplex.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Routing Table </b>&nbsp;or routing information base (RIB) is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics associated with routes.<br/>
<br/>
To transfer or communicate with other systems , the system needs the source (his) IP address, source MAC address, destination (target) IP Address, destination MAC Address and a port number (to connect through).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Router </b>Layer 3<br/>
<b>Switch </b>Layer 2<br/>
<br/>
We need to reduce the amount of broadcasts over the network, we need to reduce the number of collisions on the network. And we can do this using <b>segmenting</b>.<br/>
The main purpose of <b>Bridge </b>is to segment a network. A bridge is a software based. A bridge can only have one spanny tree instance. Bridge is Full-Duplex.<br/>
<br/>
With switch, we can break broadcast at layer 2, by creating VLAN's (Virtual Local Area Networks). By default, all switches are part of the VLAN 1. Switch breaks collision domains.<br/>
Router breaks the broadcast domains by default. Router creates a routing table.<br/>
<br/>
A <b>Patch Panel </b>in a Local Area Network (LAN) is a mounted hardware assembly that contains ports used to connect and manage incoming and outgoing LAN cables. Patch panels are also reffered to as <b>Patch bays</b>, <b>Patch fields </b>or <b>Jack field</b>s and are also commonly used in radio and television.<br/>
You wanna have a centralized wiring system.<br/>
<br/>
Internetworking devices: Bridges, hubs, switches, routers, wireless routers, firewalls.<br/>
Problem with wireless is that it is unsecure.</body></html>
