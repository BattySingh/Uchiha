</head><body>A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.<br/>
Javascript is Case Sensitive.<br/>
The semicolon tells Javascript interpreter when a step is over, incidcting that it should move to the next step.<br/>
<br/>
Some statements are surrounded by curly braces, these are known as Code Blocks. Code blocks will often be used to group together many more statements. This helps programmers organize their code and make it more readable.<br/>
<br/>
You should write comments to explain what your code does.<br/>
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. Once you leave the page, the browser will forget any information it holds.<br/>
A variable is named so because the data stored in a variable can change each time a script runs.<br/>
<br/>
Numeric data type handles numbers.<br/>
String data type consists of letters and other characters.<br/>
Boolean data type can have one of two values: true, false.<br/>
<br/>
In Javascript, you do not need to specify what type of data will be stored in the variable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our code &nbsp;-&gt; (enterss the javascript engine, in there), Parser (checks the javascript syntax and converts the code to [<b>Abstract Syntax Tree</b>]) -&gt; (which when passes through process) Convert to Machine Code -&gt; [<b>here our code is Machine code</b>] and our code runs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each code in Javascript is to be run in an Environment, and this environment is called <b>Execution Context </b>(a box, or container, or a wrapper which stores variables and in which a piece of our code is evaluated and executed).<br/>
The default context is the <b>Global Execution Context</b>. (the code is not inside any function, and it is associated with global object. In browser, it is the window object.)<br/>
Each function gets it's own new Execution Context. Execution Context gets removed as functions finish executing.</body></html>
