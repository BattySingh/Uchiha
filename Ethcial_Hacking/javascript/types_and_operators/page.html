<br/>
typeof variableName -&gt; typeof is an operator and tells us the type of the variable, which means what type of value is stored inside the variable.<br/>
<br/>
x.toString(); -&gt; converts variabke x value to string type<br/>
<br/>
Number.parseFloat("1.222"); -&gt; Number is an object<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
let save = true; // storing boolean in variable<br/>
save = !save; // to convert true to false using NOT operator<br/>
<br/>
person is an object, object is created using curly braces<br/>
let person = {<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">firstName: 'Goku'</li>
</ul>
}<br/>
<br/>
person.firstName -&gt; to access properties of object<br/>
<br/>
Symbol -&gt; data type can be used a property in an object, such as firstName, but it is hidden. There are information in object that you might want to hide, there you use symbols.<br/>
<br/>
(3.2234).toFixed(2) -&gt; used to pick decimal after dot. But it converts the number to a string, so convert it to number<br/>
<br/>
<b>Spread</b>&nbsp;operator is ... (3 periods). It is used to add the elements of an existing array into a new array. It can be used to pass the elements of the array as arguments to the function. It can be used to copy arrays. It can be used to concatenate arrays.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Rest</b>&nbsp;operator: It is like the spread operator, it condense multiple elements into an array.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Destructuring</b>&nbsp;Assignment is a Javascript syntax that allows us to extract data from arrays and objects into distinct variables. It is used to assign variables from objects. Used to assign variabes from nested objects. Also used to assign variables from arrays. It is used to reassign array elements. It can be used to pass an object as a functions parameters.<br/>
Ex: var vowel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54};<br/>
const {x, y, z} = vowel; -&gt; this creates 3 variables x, y, z, and stores vowel values into each variable.<br/>
or const {x: a, y: b, z: c} = vowel; -&gt; copy value of x into a, etc.</body></html>
