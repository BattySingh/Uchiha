</head><body>Main differece between functions and expression functions is that , functions are hoisted while expression functions are not. You can declare fucntions anywhere, but website will use hoisting to put function declarations on top of program, whereas, function expressions should be declared before they can be used, hoisting is not applied to function expressions.<br/>

<b>There is no Function overloading in Javascript, since it allows to pass any number of paramters of any type.<br/>
