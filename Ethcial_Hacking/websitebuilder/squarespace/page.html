</head><body>SquareSpace is a powerful platform for building websites.<br/>
Anthony Casalena developed SquareSpace as a blog-hosting service while attending the University of Maryland. He founded the company in 2004, and was its only employee until 2006.<br/>
SquareSpace combines web hosting and content managemnet system into a single subscription.<br/>
<br/>
SquareSpace website al use a template. New templates can be created using Developer Mode.<br/>
Parallax scrolling is a visual effect where the background image moves at a different rate than the content around it. It is often used to immerse a visitor in the experience.<br/>
<br/>
SquareSpace templates do not allow per-page style customizations, any changes made in the style editor will affect all pages in the site.<br/>
DIY -&gt; Do It Yourself.<br/>
With custom CSS, HTML and Javscript code injections extensive per-page style customizations can be achieved.<br/>
'Brine' template family has the most flexible layout. For stores<br/>

'Tremont' Template family -&gt; for portfolios.<br/>

A wireframe is a draft of the layout for a webpage without any of the styling elemets. Wireframes help in planning the site content without the distraction of specific pictures, fonts and colors.<br/>
Cover Pages are special page layouts and do not have the header or footer of the rest site. You cannot add or remove content blocks from Cover Pages. Each Cover Page has specific fields for entering content into the Cover Page and a dedicated style editor that has Cover page only style. Additional content and styles can be added to a Cover Page but it has to be done through Code Injection.<br/>
<br/>
Albums are a special type of page for adding audio files to the site. Like Record Cover Page, additional blocks of content cannot be added to the Album page. The main difference is that the ALbum page will display the regular header and footer where the Record Page does not.<br/>
<br/>
Folders are a non-content type of item that can be added to the site. A folder in the navigation will create a sub-navigation section.<br/>
Links are another type of non-content item. Links can be a Content link, file link, or external link. Content links are links to other pages within the website. File links are links to a PDF or other file that is stored in the Files section of the site. External links are links to other websites.<br/>
<br/>
Collection is the term used by SquareSpace to reference a group of items. An index page is a collection of regular pages. Index pages pull the content of the regular pages, and not the entire regular pages; therefore it is not possible to password protect a single page within an Index. The entire Index page can be password protected in the index page's settings.<br/>
<br/>
Gallery pages are used for displaying a group of images or videos.<br/>
The Blog, or Blog list, is another type of collection that contains blog posts.<br/>
The Events page is a Collection of individual Event items.<br/>
The Products page is the online store. It is the collection that contains all the items for sale in the store. SquareSpace supports three types of products: digital, service and physical. Digital products are purchased and then downloaded. Service products are for services provided by a person. Physical products are products that are shipped to a customer or require the collection of sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
SquareSpace blocks are used to add content to the website.<br/>
Image block is for adding a single image to a section of the site.<br/>
Gallery blocks add a collection of images to the block.<br/>
Summary blocks are similar to gallery block int that they display a group of information. Summary block can only be used with product, event, blog and gallery collection.<br/>
Code block is another useful block. Code blocks can accept HTML, CSS and Javascript code. Code blocks are used for adding third-party plug-ins to the site as well as creating custom features not already included in SquareSpace.<br/>
Any section where blocks can be added uses a 12-column grid.<br/>
<br/>
HSLa -&gt; Hue, saturation, luminosity and opacity.<br/>
<br/>
SquareSpace allows code injectors to allow us to add HTML, CSS and Javascript to the website.</body></html>
