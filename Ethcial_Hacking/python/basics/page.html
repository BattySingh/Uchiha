Packages are commonly used, shared code libraries that are freely available for anyone to use.<br/>
Python emphasises readibility.<br/>
Most Python implementations do a partial compile of scripts, turning the source code into byte code which can run on any supported platform.<br/>
Python is licensed under the OSI open-source license, and there are several python implementations: CPython (available from official python website.), anaconda (for scientific and machine learning tasks), ironPython (built on .NET runtime.) and Jupyter notebooks (web based interactive programming environment)<br/>
<br/>
Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.<br/>
