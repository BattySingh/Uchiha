<title>malware</title>
</head><body>Malware is Malicious code designed to install covertly on a target system. It could be designed to destroy data, install additional programs, exfiltrate (steal) data.<br/>
<br/>
It's ultimately designed to Compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of victim's data (CIA).<br/>
Malware is Evolving.<br/>
<br/>
APT -&gt; Advanced Persistent Threat<br/>
<br/>
<b>How do systems get infected?<br/>
</b>1. Direct access to a host system, like using pendrives.<br/>
2. Social Engineering<br/>
3. Phishing, like spear-phishing (attack from someone target may now), whale-phishing (targetting high value targets)<br/>
4. Visiting a malicious website.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Major forms of Malware:<br/>
</b>1. Viruses -&gt; repicates and infect others. Self-replicating and installs itself into a user's data or applications. (triggered typically via some action.)<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">Two categories of viruses:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none">1. Compiled virus: executed by the OS and can be an infected file or a boot sector virus</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">2. Interpreted virus: executed by an application(macro or script virus)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
2. Worms<br/>
3. Trojan Horse -&gt; Non-replicating malicious program that has a hidden payload. It is a self--contained program. Often disguised as a friendly program or application. It replace exisiting files with malicious ones and/or deliver additional attacker tools to the host system.<br/>
4. Mobile attacks -&gt; Code delivered remotely that runs on a local host, typically runs without host intervention. Java, ActiveX and VBScript are examples of popular languages used for infection.<br/>
5. Blended attacks -&gt; Uses multiple methods of transmission. Combines propagation characteristics viruses and worms. Can be delivered via various methods including via Trojan Horses.<br/>
<br/>
RAT -&gt; Remote Access Tool<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First Computer Virus in 1971 -&gt; Creeper Virus<br/>
In 1991, Melissa Worm targeted MS Outlook<br/>
In 2000, I Love You Virus, one of the most damaging worms of all times.<br/>
<br/>
SCADA -&gt; Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition<br/>
