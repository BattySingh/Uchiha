</head><body>Searching is a process of finding a location of an element.<br/>
Searching element is called a "<b>key</b>".<br/>
<br/>
Methods of searching:<br/>
<b>1.) Linear Search:- In linear search, we search for an element one-by-one. Once we find an element, search is success and search stops. It takes O(n) time.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Binary Search: For this search, it is mandatory that elements are in the sorted order. Only then, we can perform binary search. It is like how we search pages in a book. It takes &nbsp;O(log n) time. It is faster compared to linear search.<br/>
