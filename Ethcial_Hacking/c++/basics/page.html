In C# and Java, Generics are resolved at Run-Time.<br/>
Templates in C++ are resolved at Compile Time.<b><br/>

HOW TEXT BECOMES EXECUTABLE<br/>
<br/>
</b>A compiler takes source code you can read and write, and transforms it into a different format.<br/>
&nbsp;- The compiler gives you error messages if it can't compiler your code<br/>
&nbsp;- The output is generally called an object file.<br/>
<br/>
A large program is made up of several files, and each file is compiled, then the object files are linked together to create an executable file (exe)<br/>
&nbsp;- the linker gives you error messages if it can't link the objects.<br/>
<br/>
Finally you run the application.<br/>
<br/>
3 types of time in c++ program: 1. Compile time &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Run time &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Link time<br/>

<br/>
C++ is older than Windows<br/>
<br/>
C++ is case sensitive.<br/>

STL -&gt; Standard Template Library<br/>
<br/>
C++ supports stream I/O with operators<br/>
&nbsp;- &gt;&gt; sends something to stream<br/>
&nbsp;- &lt;&lt; reads something from a stream</span></body></html>
