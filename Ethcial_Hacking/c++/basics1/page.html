It is good for usecases when the application has to run closer to the hardware, ex. robots.<br/>
C++ was created in 1979.<br/>
<br/>
The C++ Core Guidelines are a set of best practices, recommendations and rules for coding in C++ which have been developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and hundreds of other experts in the field. These guidelines are important part of the language, as they help users to write the best, most up-to date C++ possible.<br/>
<br/>
The C++ Standard Library is a collection of classes and functions, which are written in the core language and part of the C++ ISO Standard itself. Standard Library functions and classes exist in the std:: namespace. Typically, in order to use a Standard Library feature we must both include the necessary header file and also namespace the class with std::.<br/>
<br/>
GCC -&gt; GNU Compiler Collection<br/>
In order to use classes and functions from the C++ Standard Library, the compiler must have access to a compiled version of the standard library, stored in object files.<br/>
Make and CMake are two different build tools that both serve to help simplify the process of building software. Build tools automate the process fo compiling multiple source code files into object files, linking those object files together, and generating an executable. Build tools also automate the process of determining which files have changed since the last build and thus need to be recompiled.<br/>
<br/>
Make is a widely used build tool that relies on Makefile to automate the process of building a process.<br/>
CMake relies on a CMakeLists.txt file, to configure appropriate cross-platforn targets.<br/>
<br/>
Debuggers are tools that allow you to pause the execution of your code in various locations, inspect the state of the program and step through your code line-by-line.<br/>
GDB and LLDB are two popular debuggers for C++.<br/>
<br/>
The compiler converts your code into an executable program that the computer cn run.<br/>
Every program contains a main function which is executed automatically when the program is run.<br/>
<br/>
#include is a preprocessor directive which is executed before the code is compiled.<br/>
Namespaces are a way to group identifiers together. They provide context for identifiers to avoid naming collision.<br/>
"using" command adds std::cout to the global scope of the program.</body></html>
