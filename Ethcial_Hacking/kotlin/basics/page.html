</head><body>Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language, developed by Jetbrains. It's around 2011. It is primary language for Android app development.<br/>
<br/>
There should always be a main function in your kotlin file.<br/>
<br/>
fun main() { // fun is a keyword used to declare and define a function, with main as a function<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">println("hello"); // println is used to output message onto the screen.</li>
</ul>
}<br/>
<br/>
print -&gt; function can also be used to display message onto the console screen<br/>
And always use "" -&gt; double quotes to output string, single quotes causes error.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 types of variables in kotlin: 1) Mutable (whose value can be reassigned) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;defined using "<b>var</b>" keyword<br/>
2.) Local desfined read only variables (who have value assigned to them only once) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; defined using "<b>val</b>" keuword<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
val variableName: variableType = variableValue;<br/>
Ex: val name: String = "Goku";<br/>
<br/>
If we try to re-assign value to the val variable, compiler gives us an error.<br/>
<br/>
// -&gt; is for single line commenting code<br/>
<br/>
Difference between println() and print() &nbsp;is that println() adds enters or let's say it takes cursor to the new line, while print() does not, and if we write text using print(), text just gets entered in horizontal.<br/>
<br/>
In kotlin, we can define variables outside of functions or classes, making them global variables, and they are called "Top Level Variables".</body></html>
