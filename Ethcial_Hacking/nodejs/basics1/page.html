</head><body>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform Javscript runtime environment.<br/>
Node.js runs the V8 engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.<br/>
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevents Javascript code from blocking. Libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms.<br/>
<br/>
When Node.js performs I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting cpu cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back. This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server.<br/>
<br/>
Node.js is Javascript outside the browser. So, Javascript can run over the server now. So, now we can build fast, highly scalable network applications.<br/>
<br/>
Uses of Node.js:<br/>
1.) API with database behind it<br/>
2.) Data streaming (like youtube)<br/>
3.) Real-time chat application<br/>
4.) Server-side web application<br/>
<br/>
Don't use Node.js: For <b>Applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU intensive).</b><br/>
<br/>
Node.js was formed in 2009. 2010:<b>&nbsp;Express</b>&nbsp;and <b>socket.io</b>&nbsp;are born. 2011 <b>hapi </b>&nbsp;is born.<br/>
First blogging platform using node.js was formed in 2013 called <b>GHOST. Koa </b>is born.<br/>
In 2014, <b>io.js</b>&nbsp;is created. 2016, <b>Yarn </b>is born.<br/>
<br/>
<b>nvm</b>&nbsp;is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the Node.js versions, and install new versions and easily rollback if something breaks.<br/>
When Node.js is installed, you will have <b>node </b>executable installed.<br/>
You do not have document, window, etc in Node.js.</body></html>
